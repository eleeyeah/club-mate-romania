This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

1. Raising brand awareness and developing a customer network
2. Targeting urban young people between 18-45 means we should aim for a modern and dynamic design
3. We'll incorporate Club-Mate's green and brown color scheme along with a retro, minimalistic style.
4. Based on your input, here's a suggested sitemap:
   Home: Hero section highlighting Club-Mate, Call to Action button to "Find Stores"
   About: Club-Mate's history and its influence on the club scene, plus an "About Us" section detailing your company's endeavors
   Blog: Featuring recipes and events related to Club-Mate
   Contact: Contact forms and an embedded map displaying partner locations
   Dashboard (admin only): For blog entry administration
The homepage should have an attention-grabbing hero section with a clear "Find Stores" call to action.
The "About" section can include a timeline of Club-Mate's history and its connection to the club scene, plus a company "About Us" section.
The blog should be well-organized, with categories for recipes and events.
The contact page should make it easy for users to get in touch and find partner locations.
5. Mobile responsiveness and fast load times will be crucial to engage your target audience effectively.
